# The Role of Depth, Width, and Tree Size in Expressiveness of Deep Forest

This is the code for ECAI 2024 paper "[The Role of Depth, Width, and Tree Size in Expressiveness of Deep Forest](https://lyushenhuan.github.io/papers/lyu2024role.pdf)" by Shen-Huan Lyu, Jin-Hui Wu, Qin-Cheng Zheng, and Baoliu Ye. In the paper, we theoretically prove that depth can exponentially enhance the expressiveness of deep forests compared with width and tree size.

## Getting Started

The packages used are shown below.

```
conda create -n deepTree python=3.9
conda activate deepTree
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy==1.13
pip install scikit-learn==1.4.2
```
